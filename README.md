- 👋 Hi, I’m @tellmathieu
- 👀 I’m interested in plants, servers, machine learning, python, django, and just cool stuff! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AWS, botany, and django.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something to do with plants and technology. I'm doing a postbacc in botany.
- 📫 How to reach me -> can you direct message on GitHub? I'll figure that out later.
